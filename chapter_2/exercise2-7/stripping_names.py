# Replace _ with your answers

# Store someone's name in spaced_name variable, leaving all the other character as is.
# Then, print it with lstrip(), rstrip() and strip() functions to see what happens!
# Extra: Can you figure out what the character combinations, \t and \n, are doing?

spaced_name = "     \t   Eric    Matthes   \n          "

print(_.lstrip())
