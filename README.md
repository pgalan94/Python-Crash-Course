# Python Crash Course

## I am not the original owner. 

Forked from https://github.com/systrauss/Python-Crash-Course. 

In this branch I'm creating what I wish I had when I finished reading *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes first section, a quick way to go through the exercises again.
Inspired by systrauss, websites like HackerRank and the book itself, I had the idea to create this repository.

In here you will find folders for chapters and the exercises of that chapter, and pieces of code or text files to help you go through the book's exercises.
Also, the resolution to the problems will sometimes be present in another folder called "example". The code here is mainly the code from the forked repository
Right now I only made this "new feature" for chapters 1, 2 and 3, but I plan on doing so to all the chapters in the book.


Thanks systrauss!!

## If you are not the original owner

Please feel free to look around. I am trying to develop my programming skills, so I can't promise you'll find anything good. 

My comments in code leave something to be desired, so feel free to mock me for it. Hopefully then I will fix it.

### Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to work through the exercises presented in *Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes. For the first part of the book, the exercises will be broken apart by chapter, with each chapter having its own folder. This is subject to change, pending on reusing pieces of code.
