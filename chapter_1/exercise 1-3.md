## Projects I would like to do:

1. Rewrite my gammasearch code in Python, with proper organization
2. See about making a robust gamma-fitting program?
3. Look into pyroot/rootpy and potentially rewriting my root analysis code in python

Making a video game would be pretty awesome. Making the gammasearch code work as an applet would be a nice addition to my website!
